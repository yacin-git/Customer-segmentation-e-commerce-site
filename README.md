# Customer segmentation eCommerce site (Olist)
Olist, a Portuguese e-commerce site, wants to perform a segmentation of its customers.
The objective is to understand the different types of users thanks to their behavior and their personal data.
This segmentation must be relevant and easily actionable by the marketing team. 
It must also be accompanied by a maintenance contract proposal based on an analysis of the stability of the segments over time.

## Conduct of the study
1 - Description and cleaning of the dataset </br>
2 - Explanation of the different modeling approaches (DBSCAN, KMeans) </br>
3 - Implementation of the segmentation </br>
4 - Presentation of persona (the different types of users) </br>
5 - Stability and maintenance </br>
6 - Proposal for improvement </br>

DBSCAN : More than 95% of clients are in cluster 0 and 1 </br>
=> Segmentation not very relevant and difficult to activate </br>
KMeans : The 5 clusters are fairly well distributed and show easily noticeable differences </br>
=> Relevant and easily activated segmentation </br>
